## General info
The task of this project is to prepare the REST API interface to support the working time of employees in the company. With this solution, you can easily check whether the employee came to work and when he started work. I used the REST API interface, which complies with the REST design principles, i.e. the representational state transfer architecture style. The main application engine is Spring Boot. I used Spring Security together with JWT (JSON Web Token) as a security measure. I use the MySQL database as the data source. I used HIBERNATE to manage the database. The POSTMAN program was used to test the API.
## Security
Spring Security was used in this project. Access to all resources has been blocked except login and user registration. JWT (JSON Web Token) technology was used, which is used to identify logged in users. Authentication and authorization are done using filters. Administrator and user rights have been entered.
## Database
This project uses the MySQL database. Support for handling was Hibernate and Spring Data.
